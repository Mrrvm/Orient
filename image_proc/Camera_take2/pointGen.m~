function [p1, p2, R, t] = pointGen(width, height, nPoints, rType, tType)
%  Returns two vectors of (x,y) pixels p1 and p2 resultant of a 
%      rotation R and translation t, which is also returned.
%      
%  In:
%      width: Width of the image
%      height: Height of the image
%      nPoints: Number of points to generate
%      rType: Vector of degrees representing what rotation matrix to 
%           generate [rx ry rz]
%      tType:  Vector of distances representing what translation to 
%           generate [tx ty tz]
%  Out:
%      p1: Points before rotation/translation
%      p2: Points after rotation/translation
%      R:  Rotation matrix 
%      t:  Translation vector
