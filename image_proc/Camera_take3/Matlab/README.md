# Matlab Estimator - runAll

This program finds the accuracy of camera rotation estimations for simulated data according to the length of the baseline, the distance of the points to the camera, the pixel noise in the images, and also provides results with the error (in relation to the ground truth) according to the angle for a specific situations (for example, having baseline or not, having intrinsic parameters or not). It can also find the accuracy of the camera rotation estimations for real world data, possibly presenting it according to the distance of the points to the camera.

The program ``runAll(TYPE, vars)`` takes two arguments, the first is the type of testing desired,

- ``SIM_BASELINES`` estimate rotations with simulated points based on the length of the baseline;

- ``SIM_DISTANCES`` estimate rotations with simulated points based on distance from the camera to the points;

- ``SIM_NOISES`` estimate rotations with simulated points based on pixel noise;

- ``SIM_AXISANGLES`` estimate rotations with simulated points and observe results according to the angle executed;

- ``REAL_DISTANCES`` estimate rotation with real data based on the distance from the camera to the points;

- ``REAL_AXISANGLES`` estimate rotations with simulated points and observe results according to the angle executed;

and the other is a structure with all the necessary variables to run the program for a certain type,
